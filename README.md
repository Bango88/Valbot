Code may be slightly unoptimized. If you think you can improve it, please make a pull request.

# REQUIREMENTS

Run the batch file as Administator to install the dependencies. 
Works on 64bit Windows 10 with Python 3.8 +

Install Python 3.8.0 [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-amd64.exe)
Install Python 3.9.0 [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.9.0-amd64.exe)

For the program to function properly, please copy and paste your OWN Valorant shortcut, like this one, [1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/748559485643259944/770482798867775498/unknown.png "Valorant Shortcut") for the program to function properly. This makes it so if Valorant encounters any issues when AFK, it can restart the game. You should not need to edit any code.

You also need a functioning brain, please have one of these. Don't be like this guy:

# Instructions

1- Install Python (3.9.0 is what I wrote the code in, will probably work with 3.5.x +)

2- Open _PackageInstaller.bat as admin to install dependencies using pip.

3- Close Valorant and then reopen it and leave it on the home menu, do not click anything else.

4- Open bot and navigate the menu (advised to read the information).

5- Choose which Player Card you want to use, change to that one in game and then select it in the bot console.
  You can either use the default Valorant Player Card or the Beta Pioneer Card (recommended)

6- Follow the instructions that will appear on screen if you haven't already.

7- If you encounter issues please [create one](https://github.com/MrFums/ValorantBot/issues/new) or if you have suggestions please create a [pull request](https://github.com/MrFums/ValorantBot/compare)
