# Valorant XP Farming Bot
Code may be slightly unoptimized. If you think you can improve it, please make a pull request.

# ALL IN ONE INSTALLER

Run this batch file as Administator to install the program. Works on Windows 10 with Python 3.8 +

Please note that you MUST change the Valorant shortcut in the generated folder in your root drive. Usually `C:\ValorantXPBot\`
An easy way to do this is to simply copy your own shortcut from your desktop over into the folder. This is to make it so the program can run Valorant again if it crashes.

# Instructions

1- Install Python (3.9.0 is what I wrote the code in, will probably work with 3.5.x +)

2- Open _PackageInstaller.bat as admin to install dependencies using pip.

3- Open Valorant, go to PLAY and then click on DEATHMATCH.

4- Open bot and then press 1.

5- Choose which Player Card you want to use, change to that one in game and then select it in the bot console.

6- Follow instructions that will appear on screen if you haven't already.


# Help

Make sure when installing python, you check the box next to "Add Python 3.8 to PATH"
