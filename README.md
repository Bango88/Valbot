## Features

* Fully AFK XP farmer
* Discord webhook support
* Optimized and has fail safes for events that may happen during runtime of the game
* Restarts Valorant if detects an issue with it / detects that it isn't running
* Undetected
* Easy navigation


## Requirements

Run the batch file as Administator to install the dependencies. 
Seems to only work on 64bit Windows 10 with Python 3.8 

Install Python 3.8.0 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)

For the program to function properly, please copy and paste your OWN Valorant shortcut for the program to function properly. This makes it so if Valorant encounters any issues when AFK, it can restart the game. You should not need to edit any code.

You also need a functioning brain, please have one of these.


## Instructions

1- Install Python 3.8.0.

2- Open _PackageInstaller.bat as admin to install dependencies using pip. Do this after every update.

3- If Valorant is open make sure it is on the menu and run the bot.

4- Open bot and navigate the menu (advised to read the information).

5- Put your Valorant shortcut in the bots directory.

6- Follow the instructions that will appear on screen if you haven't already.

7- If you encounter issues please [create one](https://github.com/MrFums/ValBot/issues/new) or if you have suggestions please create a [pull request](https://github.com/MrFums/ValBot/compare)

8- (Optional) Setup a Discord webhook to get updates to your discord server for when the bot has completed a game.

## Download

Click on releases and download the latest version. If you also want the shortcut maker, download that too and edit it to your liking; I will not offer support for this as it is optional and not a dependency.


## Help

Make sure when installing python, you check the box next to "Add Python 3.8 to PATH"

Please raise an Issue [here](https://github.com/MrFums/ValBot/issues/new) if you have any problems. 

Please know that I will not be wasting time helping you if you can't read requirements or need help with Python or installing it (lol).
